# ads_project
This is a course project of advanced data structure.

1. It implemented 4 heaps: BinomialHeap, BinaryHeap, FourwayCacheHeap, PairingHeap.
2. I used the 4 heaps to implement a priority queue and did the comparison in heap_benchmark.cpp
3. the encoder used the priority queue to implement a huffman-coding. The decoder used code table to
decode the compressed data.
4. The original large-input file were deleted due to the size.
5. For details, see report.pdf.
